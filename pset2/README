The provided starter code in main.c is a test driver that will automatically
run your implementation against tests contained in an external test file. We've
provided one such test file in 'test-cases'. To run the program, invoke

    ./run-tests test-file-name
    
The actual test cases are given in the following format

    pattern string
    number of text strings
    text string 1
    #matches match-pos-1 match-pos-2 ... match-pos-n
    text string 2
    #matches match-pos-1 match-pos-2 ... match-pos-n
    ...
    text string m
    #matches match-pos-1 match-pos-2 ... match-pos-n
    
For example, here is an annotated test case:

    abab       # Pattern string is 'abab'
    3          # There are three test cases to follow.
    abab       # For the text string "abab"...
    1 0        #  ...there is one match, at position 0.
    aabb       # For the text string "aabb"...
    0          #  ...there are no matches.
    ababab     # For the text string "ababab"...
    2 0 2      #  ...there are two matches, at positions 0 and 2.
    
We strongly recommend defining as many test cases as is reasonable, since there
are a good number of edge cases to check.
